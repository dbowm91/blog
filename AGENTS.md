# Agent Guidelines

Quick reference for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Agent Override Convention

This codebase uses a **module-level override system** for agent context. Each module (directory with a specific purpose) may contain an `AGENTS.override.md` file that provides specialized handling instructions for that module.

When an agent operates within a module, it should:
1. Read the root `AGENTS.md` for general guidance
2. Check for `AGENTS.override.md` in the current module for specialized handling
3. Override files take precedence over root-level guidance when working within that module

## Module Override Files

| Module | Override File | Purpose |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| App Core | `app/AGENTS.override.md` | Flask app, models, extensions, core utilities |
| Routes | `app/routes/AGENTS.override.md` | Public routes, API, RSS, services |
| Admin Routes | `app/routes/admin/AGENTS.override.md` | Admin dashboard, post/subscriber/user management |
| Frontend | `app/static/AGENTS.override.md` | JS/CSS assets, Vite build |
| Templates | `app/templates/AGENTS.override.md` | Jinja2 templates, filters |
| Tests | `tests/AGENTS.override.md` | Testing patterns, fixtures |
| OpenCode Config | `.opencode/AGENTS.override.md` | Agent tool configuration |
| Documentation | `docs/AGENTS.override.md` | Documentation structure |
| Scripts | `scripts/AGENTS.override.md` | Shell scripts, DevOps |
| Services | `app/services/AGENTS.override.md` | Backup, slug, serialization, tag services |

## Structure Convention

When adding agent guidance for a specific module:
1. Create `AGENTS.override.md` inside that module directory
2. Do not create a separate "agents" directory
3. Override files should be focused on module-specific concerns
4. Update this index when adding new override files

## Codebase Structure Reference

Important actual file locations (verify before assuming):

| Item | Actual Location |
|------|-----------------|
| API routes | `app/routes/api.py` (SINGLE FILE, not `app/routes/api/` directory) |
| Validators | `app/validators.py` (NOT `app/core/validators.py`) |
| Backup logic | `app/services/backup.py` (centralized service) |
| Admin Audit Log model | `app/models.py:397-417` |
| PostRevision model | `app/models.py:173` |
| User model `__repr__` | `app/models.py:63-64` |
| Comment model | `app/models.py` |
| Services | `app/services/` (backup, slug, serialization, tag) |

## Security & Privacy Rules

- **Log ID, not Username**: When logging user actions or system events, always use `user.id`. Never log raw User objects or usernames to prevent PII leakage.
- **Credential Protection**: Never log `SECRET_KEY`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, or API keys.

## High-Risk Files (Error Handling)

These files previously used broad `except Exception` clauses, now replaced with specific exceptions (SQLAlchemyError, OSError, ValueError) per CQ-3 completion. Review carefully when modifying error handling:
- `app/backup_encryption.py`
- `app/webhooks.py`
- `app/tasks.py`
- `app/page_view_buffer.py`
- `app/routes/admin/series.py`

## Test Interference Notes

### Page View Buffer Test Issues
- The page view buffer (`app/page_view_buffer.py`) can cause test interference when running full suite
- Buffer is started during `create_app()` if `PAGE_VIEW_BUFFER_SIZE > 0`
- In tests: disable via `app.config.PAGE_VIEW_BUFFER_SIZE = 0` and call `shutdown_page_view_buffer()`
- The `conftest.py` session-scoped `app` fixture may allow buffer restart - use autouse fixture to ensure disabled

### Test Database Session Issues
- `db.session.refresh()` fails if object isn't in current session
- Fix: Re-query object from database instead of using `refresh()`
- Example: `sub = db.session.execute(select(Subscriber).filter_by(email=...)).scalar_one_or_none()`

### E2E Test Requirements
- Requires `playwright install chromium` for browser tests
- E2E tests may timeout if application not properly started

## Test Patterns We Used
- Added tests for many low-coverage modules: series, tasks, cli, comments, scheduler, validators, backup, storage, filters
- Increased total coverage from 53% to ~75%
- Fixed RSS endpoint references in templates (rss.feed → rss.atom_feed)
- Added email field to User model to support password reset functionality
- Fixed test issues with mocks, patches, and route registrations
